## AI Analyzer

Working on AI (and other machine learning tasks) often requires careful analysis of AI perfomance.
'Performance' is a loaded word and can mean MANY things.

This app will serve as a collection of techniques, tools, and algorithms which can be used to both quantize the individual
performance of an AI agent as well as a method for us to compare results using varying ML and Deep Learning techniques.

### NEED (?)

I am currently interested in seeing how various techniques often used in various Deep Learning tasks affect 'Reinfocement
Learning' based agents performance.
